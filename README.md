=================
This repository contains ebuilds which fall into the following categories:

* ebuilds modified from those in portage for supporting
  additional features (usually with new USE flags)

* version bumped higher than those yet in the portage tree

* fixed ebuilds for updated dependencies or where there is
  bug in the portage version which hasn't yet been fixed

* all new packages not currently in portage


<h2>New ebuilds</h2>

There are many new ebuilds for packages that are not in
Portage, many of them are "live", this includes for example,
app-i18n/libphonenumber, as required for syncevolution to
build with dbus-pim support.  If anybody wants a stable version
of any of these ebuilds, let me know.  Also feel free to open
Gentoo bugzilla entries for new ebuilds from this repository,
just do please drop me a note.

<b>I have recently removed nearly all ebuilds from this repo
since it suffered from severe bit-rot and neglect.  I am 
gradually adding back ebuilds I am prepared to maintain or
if there is a request for them, but I'm going to try to keep
it clean.</b>
